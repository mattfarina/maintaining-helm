# Introduction

[Helm](https://helm.sh), the package manager for Kubernetes, has been around for more than 7 years. In that time the project became popular, grew, and changed. It is used by many and has been integrated into other cloud native tooling.

For those who want to be maintainers of Helm there is a fair amount to learn. Both in the history of how we got here and in how we handle things today. There are many questions someone might have like, how does it work? What do the processes look like? What has made it successful?

The people, processes, and community around Helm can also be help to those who want to maintain other software. They can learn how a popular project works and, possibly, find something to emulate that helps them out.

This guide is one maintainers view into maintaining Helm. It's written with 3 types of people in mind:

1. Those who are maintainers of Helm or want to help maintain Helm.
2. Users of Helm who want more insight into Helm.
3. Leaders of other open source projects who want insight into how other projects function.

The primary audience is Helm maintainers. Those who started the project like to start new projects. They have started many projects over the years. Passing along context, history, and lessons learned to maintainers who come after them helps Helm be successful long into the future.
